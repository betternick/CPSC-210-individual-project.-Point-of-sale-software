# My Personal Project

## A Point of Sale (POS) software for a restaurant.

The software I am designing for my personal project is a **point-of-sale** software for a fictional restaurant named 
*"UBC Cafe"*. Whereas in the past businesses only had the option for a simple cash register machine, these days they are using
ever more sophisticated software that are custom-designed for their needs. The very basic functionality such software 
provides is to record sales. However, they usually also archive and store data, provide menu view options, allow 
searching through past transactions, and print out summaries of transactions. Depending upon the unique requirements of 
the client, many more sophisticated features can also be added to them such as customer rewards program management, 
tax reporting features, access control, integration with the cloud etc.

The software I am designing is a basic entry-level software that can accomplish the following:

## User Stories: 
- As a user, for a customer order, I want to be able to place an order for a menu item, enter the amount paid by
 customer and know the change due to the customer. 
- As a user, I want to be able to record this order.
- As a user, I want to be able to view past orders.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the menu.
- As a user, I want to be able to add menu items to the menu.

PHASE-1
- As a user, I want to be able to save a menu.
- As a user, I want to be able to load a menu.
